I'm Arun John M Süòé a Computer Science Engineering student at Jyothi Engineering College.
My journey into the world of computers began with a spark, ignited by the endless possibilities of technology at Jyothi Engineering College. Connect with me and let's embark on a journey where code meets creativity, and stories come to life on the digital canvas!

This report summarizes my five-day internship experience at [Company Name], focusing on 3D design and industrial robotics applications in the metal and plastic industries. Through hands-on learning and industry visits, I gained valuable insights into the integration of robotics and design in manufacturing processes.

## DAY 1Ô∏è‚É£
### Tinkercad and Robotics Fundamentals
Explored Tinkercad, a user-friendly 3D modeling platform, to create basic 3D models.
Created a 3d model of a house using basic shapes and functions and shared it with my friends.
